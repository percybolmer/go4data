# phylo

Phylo (pronounced "File-o") is a File operations class designed for maximum
convenience and clarity of expression. The primary export of `phylo` is the
`File` class which is used to wrap a file-system path string.

Consider some examples:

    const File = require('phylo');
    
    // Starting in cwd, climb up as needed until a directory
    // containing "package.json" is found and then load that
    // file to return an object.
    
    var pkg = File.cwd().upToFile('package.json').load();
    
    // Starting in cwd, climb up as needed to find the Git
    // VCS root directory (not the ".git" folder itself):
    
    var root = File.cwd().up('.git');

If you like infinite loops, try this on Windows:

    var path = require('path');
    
    for (var dir = process.cwd(); dir; dir = path.resolve(dir, '..')) {
        // climb up...
    }

This innocent loops works on Linux/Mac because `path.resolve('/', '..')` returns
a falsey value. On Windows, however, `path.resolve('C:\\', '..')` returns... well
`"C:\\"`.

Compare to `File`:

    for (var dir = File.cwd(); dir; dir = dir.parent) {
        // climb up...
    }

## Conventions

It is intended that a `File` instance immutably describes a single path. What is
(or is not) on disk at that location can change of course, but the description is
constant.

The `File` API strives to be purely consistent on these points:

 - Methods that take path parameters accept `String` or `File` instances.
 - Methods that end in `Path` return a `String`. Otherwise they return a `File`
  instance (when paths are involved).
 - Asynchronous methods are named with the "async" prefix and return a Promise.
 - Callbacks passed to async methods can return immediate results or Promises.

## Path Manipulation

Much of the functionality provided by the `File` class is in the form of "lexical"
path manipulation. These are only provided in synchronous form since they operate on
path strings (like the `path` module).

### Properties

Instances of `File` provide these **readonly** properties:

 - `path` - The path to the file as a `String` (passed to the `constructor`).
 - `extent` - The file's type as a `String` (e.g., "json").
 - `name` - The file's name as a `String` (e.g., "package.json").
 - `parent` - The `File` for the parent directory (`null` at root).
 - `fspath` - The `path` string resolved for "~" (usable by `fs` or `path` modules)

### Methods

The methods that perform work on the path text and return `File` instances as a
result are:

 - `absolutify()` - Calls `path.resolve(this.path)`
 - `join()` - Joins all arguments using `path.join()`
 - `nativize()` - Make all separators native (`'\'` on Windows, `'/'` elsewhere)
 - `normalize()`- Calls `path.normalize(this.path)`
 - `relativize()`- Calls `path.relative()`
 - `resolve()`- Calls `path.resolve()` on all the arguments
 - `slashify()`- Make all separators `'/'` (Windows does understand them)
 - `terminate()` - Ensure there is a trailing separator
 - `unterminate()` - Ensure there is no trailing separator

To retrieve strings as a result, you can use these methods:

 - `absolutePath()` - Same as `absolutify` but returns a string
 - `joinPath()` - Same as `join` but returns a string
 - `nativePath()` - Same as `nativize` but returns a string
 - `normalizedPath()` - Same as `normalize` but returns a string
 - `relativePath()` - Same as `relativize` but returns a string
 - `resolvePath()` - Same as `resolve` but returns a string
 - `slashifiedPath()` - Same as `slashify` but returns a string
 - `terminatedPath()` - Same as `terminate` but returns a string
 - `unterminatedPath()` - Same as `unterminate` but returns a string

Some path operations perform I/O to the file-system and so provide both synchronous
and asynchronous versions.

 - `canonicalize()` - Calls `fs.realpathSync(this.path)` and returns a `File`
 - `canonicalPath()` - Same as `canonicalize` but returns a `String`

In asynchronous form:

 - `asyncCanonicalize()` - Same as `canonicalize` but Promises a `File`
 - `asyncCanonicalPath()` - Same as `asyncCanonicalize` but Promises a `String`

Canonicalization will result in `null` if there is no real file.

## Path Info and Comparison

You can compare two paths in a few different ways:

 - `compare(o)` - Returns -1, 0 or 1 if `this` is less, equal or greater than `o`
 - `equals(o)` - Returns `true` if `this` is equal to `o` (`compare(o) === 0`)
 - `prefixes(o)` - Returns `true` if `this` is a path prefix of `o`. Best to
  use `absolutify()` on both instances first to avoid issues with `..` segments.

File name comparisons are case-insensitive on Windows and Mac OS X, so we have

    var f1 = File.from('abc');
    var f2 = File.from('ABC');
    
    console.log(f1.equals(f2));
    
    > true   (on Windows and Mac)
    > false  (on Linux)

Some useful information about a file path:

 - `isAbsolute()` - Returns `true` if the file an absolute path (`path.isAbsolute()`)
 - `isRelative()` - Returns `true` if the file a relative path (`path.isRelative()`)

## File-System Information

To get information about the file on disk:

 - `access()` - Returns a `FileAccess` object or `null` if the file doesn't exist.
 - `can(mode)` - Returns `true` if this exists with the desired access (`mode` is "r",
  "rw", "rwx", "w", "wx" or "x").
 - `exists()` - Returns `true` if the file exists.
 - `has(rel)` - Returns `true` if a file or folder exists at the `rel` path from this file.
 - `hasDir(rel)` - Returns `true` if a folder exists at the `rel` path from this file.
 - `hasFile(rel)` - Returns `true` if a file exists at the `rel` path from this file.
 - `isHidden()` - Returns `true` if this file does not exist or is hidden.
 - `stat()` / `restat()` - Returns `fs.statSync(this.path)` (an `fs.Stats`).
 - `statLink()` / `restatLink()` - Returns `fs.lstatSync(this.path)` (an `fs.Stats`).

In asynchronous form:

 - `asyncAccess()` - Promises a `FileAccess`
 - `asyncCan(mode)` - Promises `true` or `false`.
 - `asyncExists()` - Promises `true` or `false`.
 - `asyncHas(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncHasDir(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncHasFile(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncIsHidden()` - Promises `true` or `false`
 - `asyncStat()` / `asyncRestat()` - Promises an `fs.Stats` via `fs.stat()`
 - `asyncStatLink()` / `asyncRestatLink()` - Promises an `fs.Stats` via `fs.lstat()`

### FileAccess

`FileAccess` objects are succinct descriptions of read, write and execute permission
masks. These replace the use of fs.constants.R_OK, fs.constants.W_OK and
fs.constants.X_OK. For example:
    
    let mode = fs.statSync(file).mode;
    
    if (mode & fs.constants.R_OK && mode & fs.constants.W_OK) {
        // path is R and W
    }

Or using `File` and `FileAccess`:

    if (file.access().rw) {
        // path is R and W
    }

To handle the case where the file may not exist, compare:

    try {
        let mode = fs.statSync(file).mode;
        
        if (mode & fs.constants.R_OK && mode & fs.constants.W_OK) {
            // file exists and is R and W
        }
    }
    catch (e) {
        // ignore... file does not exist
    }

But using `File` this can be:

    if (file.can('rw')) {
        // file exists and is R & W
    }

There are a fixed set of `FileAccess` objects, one for each combination of R, W and X
permissions: `r`, `rw`, `rx`, `rwx`, `w`, `wx`, `x`. Each instance also has these
same properties as boolean values. The full set of properties is a bit larger:

 - `r` - True if `R_OK` is set.
 - `rw` - True if `R_OK` and `W_OK` are both set.
 - `rx` - True if `R_OK` and `X_OK` are both set.
 - `rwx` - True if `R_OK`, `W_OK` and `X_OK` are all set.
 - `w` - True if `W_OK` is set.
 - `wx` - True if `W_OK` and `X_OK` are both set.
 - `x` - True if `X_OK` is set.
 - `mask` - The combination of `fs.constants` flags `R_OK`, `W_OK` and/or `X_OK`
 - `name` - The string "r", "rw", "rx", "rwx", "w", "wx" or "x"

### Classification

It is often important to know if a file is a directory or other type of entity. This
information is fundamentally a result of the `stat()` family but for convenience is
also provided on the `File` instance:

 - `isDirectory`
 - `isFile`
 - `isBlockDevice`
 - `isCharacterDevice`
 - `isFIFO`
 - `isSocket`
 - `isSymbolicLink`

In addition, the following shorthand methods are also available:

 - `isDir` (alias for `isDirectory()`)
 - `isSymLink` (alias for `isSymbolicLink()`)

These are also available as async methods:

 - `asyncIsDir`
 - `asyncIsDirectory`
 - `asyncIsFile`
 - `asyncIsBlockDevice`
 - `asyncIsCharacterDevice`
 - `asyncIsFIFO`
 - `asyncIsSocket`
 - `asyncIsSymLink`
 - `asyncIsSymbolicLink`

Since the nature of a file seldom changes on a whim, the results of these tests are
stored on the `File` instance. If this is undesired, it is better to stick with the
`stat()` family since it provides a way to refresh this information (`restat()`).

## Directory Listing

You can get a directory listing of `File` objects using:

 - `list(mode)`
 - `asyncList(mode)`

The `mode` parameter is a string that consists of the following single letter codes
with the described meaning:

 - `A` - All files are listed, even hidden files. (default is `false`)
 - `d` - List only directories. (default is `false`)
 - `f` - List only files (non-directories). (default is `false`)
 - `l` - Cache the result of `statLink` for each file. (default is `false`)
 - `o` - Order the items by `sorter`. (default is `true`)
 - `s` - Cache the result of `stat` for each file. (default is `false`)
 - `w` - Indicates that Windows hidden flag alone determines hidden status
  (default is `false` so that files names starting with dots are hidden on all
  platforms).
 - `T` - Throw (or reject) on failure instead of returning (or resolving) `null`.

Some examples:

    // List non-hidden files/folders:
    dir.list();

    // lists all files/folders (including hidden):
    dir.list('A');

    // lists non-hidden files/folders and cache stat info:
    dir.list('s');

    // lists all files (no folders) and cache stat info:
    dir.list('Asf');

    // lists all files/folders and cache stat info but do not sort:
    dir.list('As-o');

The `s` option can be useful during an `asyncList()` operation to allow subsequent
use of the simpler, synchronous `stat()` method since it will use the cached stat
object.

## File-System Traversal

### Ascent

To climb the file-system to find a parent folder that passes a `test` function or
has a particular file or folder relatively locatable from there:

 - `up(test)` - Starting at this, climb until `test` passes.
 - `upDir(rel)` - Use `up()` with `hasDir(rel)` as the `test`.
 - `upFile(rel)` - Use `up()` with `hasFile(rel)` as the `test`.

To climb the file-system and find a relatively locatable item:

 - `upTo(rel)` - Starting at this, climb until `has(rel)` is `true` and then return
  `join(rel)` from that location.
 - `upDir(rel)` - Same as `upTo()` but using `hasDir(rel)` as the `test`.
 - `upFile(rel)` - Same as `upTo()` but using `hasFile(rel)` as the `test`.

The different between these forms can be seen best by example:

    var file = File.cwd().up('.git');
    
    // file is the parent directory that has ".git", not the ".git"
    // folder itself. The file may be File.cwd() or some parent.
    
    var git = File.cwd().upTo('.git');
    
    // git is the ".git" folder from perhaps File.cwd() or some other
    // parent folder.

Asynchronous forms (TODO - not implemented yet):

 - `asyncUp(test)` - TODO
 - `asyncUpDir(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncUpFile(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncUpTo(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncUpDir(rel)` - TODO
 - `asyncUpFile(rel)` - TODO

### Descent

 - `tips(mode, test)` - Returns a `File[]` of the top-most items passing the `test`.
  Once a match is found, no descent into that folder is made (hence, the "tips" of
  the sub-tree).
 - `walk(mode, handler)` - Calls `handler` for all items that `list(mode)` generates
  recursively.

The `walk` method's `handler` looks like this:

    function handler (file, state) {
        if (file.isDir() && ...) {
            return false;  // do not recurse into this dir
        }
        
        if (...) {
            state.stop = true;  // stop all further walking
        }
    }
    
The `state` object has the following members:

 - `at` - The current `File` being processed.
 - `previous` - The `File` previously passed to the handler.
 - `stack` - A `File[]` of instances starting with the `File` used to start things.
 - `stop` - A boolean property that can be set to `true` to abort the `walk`.
 
The `tips` method's `test` looks like this:

    function test (file, state) {
        if (file.hasFile('package.json')) {
            return true; // file is a tip so gather it up and don't descend
        }
        
        return false; // keep going and/or descending
    }

The `state` parameter is the same as for the `handler` on the `walk` method.
 
Asynchronous forms:

 - `asyncTips(mode, test)`
 - `asyncWalk(mode, handler)`

The `test` and `handler` methods of the asynchronous methods accept the same
parameters and can return the same results as with the synchronous forms. They
can alternatively return a Promise if their determination is also async.

## Reading / Loading Files

Basic file reading and decoding/parsing are provided by these methods:

 - `load(options)` - Reads, decodes and parses the file according to `options`.
 - `asyncLoad(options)` - Same as `load()` except a Promise is returned

The act of loading a file consists initially of reading the data (obviously). To
get this part right, you need an `encoding` option which is tedious to setup in
the `fs` API, especially if the file name holds the clues you need.

Compare:

    var pkg = path.join(dir, 'package.json'); // a string

    var data = JSON.parse(fs.readfileSync(pkg, {
        encoding: 'utf8'
    }));

To loading using `File`:

    var pkg = dir.join('package.json'); // a File

    var data = pkg.load();  // a parsed Object

The basic advantage of the `File` approach is the error messages you get when
things go wrong. Using the first snippet you would get errors like these (based
on the parser used):

    Unexpected number in JSON at position 427

Using `load()` the message would be:

    Cannot parse ~/code/package.json: Unexpected number in JSON at position 427

With `File` there is hope in tracking down what has gone wrong.

### Loader Options

The default loader is based on the file's type, but we can override this:
    
    var data = pkg.load('text'); // load as a simple text (not parsed)
    
Other options can be specified (e.g. to split by new-line):
    
    var data = pkg.load({
        type: 'text',
        split: /\n/g
    });

This simplicity is accomplished using a `File.Loader` instance or simply a `loader`.
Loaders are identified by name such as `text`, `binary` or `json`. By default,
the file's extension (`extent` property) is used to select the `loader`. This will
default to `text` for files with unrecognized extensions.

Loaders support the following configuration properties:

 - `parse` - A function called to parse the file content. The method accepts two
  arguments: `data` and `loader`. The `data` parameter is the file's content and
  the `loader` is the fully configured `loader` instance.
 - `split` - An optional `RegExp` or `String` for a call to `String.split()`. This
  is used by the default `parse` method.

In addition to `loader` configuration, the `fs.readFile()` options can be supplied:

    var content = file.load({
        // The options object is passed directly to fs.readFile()
        options: {
            ...
        }
    });

The `encoding` can be specified in the `options` or directly to the `loader`:

    var content = file.load({
        encoding: 'utf16'
    });

    // Or on the fs options:
    
    var content = file.load({
        options: {
            encoding: 'utf16'
        }
    });

## Static Methods

The most useful static methods are for conversion.

    var file = File.from(dir);

Regardless if the value of `dir` above is a `String` or `File`, `file` is a `File`
instance. If `dir` is `null` or `''` then `file` will be `null`.

In reverse:

    var s = File.path(file);

The `path()` method accepts `String` or `File` and returns the path (the original
string or the `path` property of the `File`). Similar to `from()`, the `path()` method
returns `''` when passed `null`. That value is still "falsey" but won't throw null
reference errors if used.

### Utility Methods

 - `access(fs)` - Returns a `FileAccess` for the `File` or `String`.
 - `exists(fs)` - Returns true if the `File` or `String` exists.
 - `isDir(fs)` - Returns true if the `File` or `String` is an existing directory.
 - `isFile(fs)` - Returns true if the `File` or `String` is an existing file.
 - `join(fs...)` - Return `path.join()` on the `File` or `String` args as a `File`.
 - `joinPath(fs...)` - Return `path.join()` on the `File` or `String` args as a `String`.
 - `resolve(fs...)` - Return `path.resolve()` on the `File` or `String` args as a `File`.
 - `resolvePath(fs...)` - Return `path.resolve()` on the `File` or `String` args as a `String`.
 - `split(fs)`- Returns a `String[]` from the `File` or `String`.
 - `sorter(fs1, fs2)` - Calls `File.from(fs1).compare(fs2)` (useful for sorting
  `File[]` and `String[]`).

There are no asynchronous forms of these utility methods since they wouldn't really
save much:

Since this is not provided:

    File.asyncExists(file).then(exists => {
        ...
    });

Instead just do this:

    File.from(file).asyncExists().then(exists => {
        ...
    });

## Special Folders

 - `cwd()` - Wraps `process.cwd()` as a `File`.
 - `home()` - Wraps `os.homedir()` as a `File`.
 - `profile()` - Returns the platform-favored storage folder for app data.

The `profile()` method handles the various OS preferences for storing application
data.

 - Windows: `C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming\Company`
 - Mac OS X: `/Users/Name/Library/Application Support/Company`
 - Linux: `/home/name/.local/share/data/company`
 - Default: `/home/name/.company`

The "Company" part can be passed as the argument to `profile()` but is better left to
the top-level application to set `File.COMPANY`.

    File.COMPANY = 'Acme';

Now all libraries that use `phylo` will automatically store their profile data in the
proper folder for the user-facing application. In such a scenario it would be wise to
use the module name in the filename to ensure no collisions occur.

### The Magic Tilde

A common "pseudo" root folder for the user's home folder is `"~"`. One often sees
paths like this:

    var dir = new File('~/.acme');

The `"~"` pseudo-root is recognized throughout `File` methods. It is resolved to the
actual location using `absolutify()` or `canonicalize()` (or their other flavors). In
other cases the pseudo-root is preserved. For example:

    var dir = new File('~/.acme');
    
    console.log(dir.parent); // just "~"
    console.log(dir.join('foo'));  // ~/acme/foo

These `File` instances can be read using `load()` as well:

    var data = File.from('~/.acme/settings.json').load();

In addition there is also the `"~~/"` pseudo-root that maps the the `profile()` directory
instead of the raw homedir.

That is:

    File.COMPANY = 'Acme';

    console.log(File.from('~/foo').absolutePath());
    console.log(File.from('~~/foo').absolutePath());

    // Windows:
    > C:\Users\MyName\foo
    > C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Roaming\Acme\foo

    // Mac OS X:
    > /Users/MyName/foo
    > /Users/MyName/Library/Application Support/foo

## Creating Directories

You can create a directory structure using the `mkdir()` method (or `asyncMkdir()`).
These methods create as many directory levels as needed to create the path described
by the `File` instance.

    var dir = File.from('~~/foo').mkdir();

The `mkdir()` method returns the `File` instance after creating the directory tree.

Unlike many other `File` methods, if `mkdir()` fails it will throw an `Error`.
