 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * {@a is-stable-examples}
 * ### isStable examples and caveats
 *
 * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:
 * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind
 * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts
 * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`
 * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);
 * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task
 * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),
 * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *      filter(stable => stable)
 *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');
 *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,
 * and the trace "App is stable now" will never get logged.
 *
 * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,
 * you have to wait for the application to be stable
 * before starting your polling process.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, the trace "App is stable now" will be logged
 * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.
 *
 * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,
 * which means that the code in the subscription
 * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.
 *
 * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,
 * you update a field of your component
 * and display it in its template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);
 * }
 * ```
 * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,
 * the `value` field will be updated properly,
 * but the template will not be refreshed!
 *
 * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => {
 *     this.value = counter;
 *     cd.detectChanges();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));

 * ### Detach change detector to limit how often check occurs

 * The following example defines a component with a large list of read-only data
 * that is expected to change constantly, many times per second.
 * To improve performance, we want to check and update the list
 * less often than the changes actually occur. To do that, we detach
 * the component's change detector and perform an explicit local check every five seconds.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>
 *
 *

 * The component detaches its change detector from the main change detector tree
 * when the `live` property is set to false, and reattaches it when the property
 * becomes true.

     * Decorator that marks a class as an Angular component and provides configuration

     * instantiated, and used at runtime.
     *
     * Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app.
     * An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components.
     *
     * Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template.
     * Unlike other directives, only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.
     *
     * A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be available
     * to another component or application. To make it a member of an NgModule,
     * list it in the `declarations` field of the `NgModule` metadata.
     *
     * Note that, in addition to these options for configuring a directive,
     * you can control a component's runtime behavior by implementing
     * life-cycle hooks. For more information, see the
     * [Lifecycle Hooks](guide/lifecycle-hooks) guide.
     *
     * @usageNotes
     *
     * ### Setting component inputs
     *
     * The following example creates a component with two data-bound properties,
     * specified by the `inputs` value.
     *
     * <code-example path="core/ts/metadata/directives.ts" region="component-input"></code-example>
     *
     *
     * ### Setting component outputs
     *
     * The following example shows two event emitters that emit on an interval. One
     * emits an output every second, while the other emits every five seconds.
     *
     * {@example core/ts/metadata/directives.ts region='component-output-interval'}
     *
     * ### Injecting a class with a view provider
     *
     * The following simple example injects a class into a component
     * using the view provider specified in component metadata:
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Greeter {
     *    greet(name:string) {
     *      return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
     *    }
     * }
     *
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'needs-greeter'
     * })
     * class NeedsGreeter {
     *   greeter:Greeter;
     *
     *   constructor(greeter:Greeter) {
     *     this.greeter = greeter;
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * @Component({
     *   selector: 'greet',
     *   viewProviders: [
     *     Greeter
     *   ],
     *   template: `<needs-greeter></needs-greeter>`
     * })
     * class HelloWorld {
     * }
     *
     * ```
     *
     * ### Preserving whitespace
     *
     * Removing whitespace can greatly reduce AOT-generated code size and speed up view creation.
     * As of Angular 6, the default for `preserveWhitespaces` is false (whitespace is removed).
     * To change the default setting for all components in your application, set
     * the `preserveWhitespaces` option of the AOT compiler.
     *
     * By default, the AOT compiler removes whitespace characters as follows:
     * * Trims all whitespaces at the beginning and the end of a template.
     * * Removes whitespace-only text nodes. For example,
     *
     * ```html
     * <button>Action 1</button>  <button>Action 2</button>
     * ```
     *
     * becomes:
     *
     * ```html
     * <button>Action 1</button><button>Action 2</button>
     * ```
     *
     * * Replaces a series of whitespace characters in text nodes with a single space.
     * For example, `<span>\n some text\n</span>` becomes `<span> some text </span>`.
     * * Does NOT alter text nodes inside HTML tags such as `<pre>` or `<textarea>`,
     * where whitespace characters are significant.
     *
     * Note that these transformations can influence DOM nodes layout, although impact
     * should be minimal.
     *
     * You can override the default behavior to preserve whitespace characters
     * in certain fragments of a template. For example, you can exclude an entire
     * DOM sub-tree by using the `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute:
     *
     * ```html
     * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>
     *     whitespaces are preserved here
     *     <span>    and here </span>
     * </div>
     * ```
     *
     * You can force a single space to be preserved in a text node by using `&ngsp;`,
     * which is replaced with a space character by Angular's template
     * compiler:
     *
     * ```html
     * <a>Spaces</a>&ngsp;<a>between</a>&ngsp;<a>links.</a>
     * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>
     *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>
     * ```
     *
     * Note that sequences of `&ngsp;` are still collapsed to just one space character when
     * the `preserveWhitespaces` option is set to `false`.
     *
     * ```html
     * <a>before</a>&ngsp;&ngsp;&ngsp;<a>after</a>
     * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>
     *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>
     * ```
     *
     * To preserve sequences of whitespace characters, use the
     * `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute.

/**
 * Stores DOM operations which need to be applied to update DOM render tree due to changes in
 * expressions.
 *
 * The basic idea is that `i18nExp` OpCodes capture expression changes and update a change
 * mask bit. (Bit 1 for expression 1, bit 2 for expression 2 etc..., bit 32 for expression 32 and
 * higher.) The OpCodes then compare its own change mask against the expression change mask to
 * determine if the OpCodes should execute.
 *
 * These OpCodes can be used by both the i18n block as well as ICU sub-block.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Assume
 * ```ts
 *   if (rf & RenderFlags.Update) {
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp1); // If changed set mask bit 1
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp2); // If changed set mask bit 2
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp3); // If changed set mask bit 3
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp4); // If changed set mask bit 4
 *    i18nApply(0);            // Apply all changes by executing the OpCodes.
 *  }
 * ```
 * We can assume that each call to `i18nExp` sets an internal `changeMask` bit depending on the
 * index of `i18nExp`.
 *
 * ### OpCodes
 * ```ts
 * <I18nUpdateOpCodes>[
 *   // The following OpCodes represent: `<div i18n-title="pre{{exp1}}in{{exp2}}post">`
 *   // If `changeMask & 0b11`

 *   //        has NOT changed then skip `7` values and start processing next OpCodes.
 *   0b11, 7,

 * Creates a token that can be used in a DI Provider.
 *
 * Use an `InjectionToken` whenever the type you are injecting is not reified (does not have a
 * runtime representation) such as when injecting an interface, callable type, array or
 * parameterized type.
 *
 * `InjectionToken` is parameterized on `T` which is the type of object which will be returned by
 * the `Injector`. This provides additional level of type safety.
 *
 * ```
 * interface MyInterface {...}
 * var myInterface = injector.get(new InjectionToken<MyInterface>('SomeToken'));
 * // myInterface is inferred to be MyInterface.
 * ```
 *
 * When creating an `InjectionToken`, you can optionally specify a factory function which returns
 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function. See below for an example.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Basic Example
 *

/**
 * A ReflectiveDependency injection container used for instantiating objects and resolving
 * dependencies.
 *
 * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
 * constructor dependencies.
 *
 * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
 * resolved by the `Injector`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example creates an `Injector` configured to create `Engine` and `Car`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Injectable()
 * class Engine {
 * }
 *
 * @Injectable()
 * class Car {

 *
 * var injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
 * var car = injector.get(Car);
 * expect(car instanceof Car).toBe(true);
 * expect(car.engine instanceof Engine).toBe(true);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice, we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
 *
 * @deprecated from v5 - slow and brings in a lot of code, Use `Injector.create` instead.

 * - in front of the template in the case of coming across additional instruction in the

 *

 * their bits set accordingly. Previous duplicate means that we may need to check previous if the

/**
 * Store the static values for the styling binding.
 *
 * The `TStylingStatic` is just `KeyValueArray` where key `""` (stored at location 0) contains the
 * `TStylingKey` (stored at location 1). In other words this wraps the `TStylingKey` such that the
 * `""` contains the wrapped value.
 *
 * When instructions are resolving styling they may need to look forward or backwards in the linked
 * list to resolve the value. For this reason we have to make sure that he linked list also contains
 * the static values. However the list only has space for one item per styling instruction. For this
 * reason we store the static values here as part of the `TStylingKey`. This means that the
 * resolution function when looking for a value needs to first look at the binding value, and than
 * at `TStylingKey` (if it exists).
 *
 * Imagine we have:
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="TEMPLATE" my-dir>
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   host: {
 *     class: 'DIR',
 *     '[class.dynamic]': 'exp' // ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * In the above case the linked list will contain one item:
 *
 * ```
 *   // assume binding location: 10 for `ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);`
 *   tData[10] = <TStylingStatic>[
 *     '': 'dynamic', // This is the wrapped value of `TStylingKey`
 *     'DIR': true,   // This is the default static value of directive binding.
 *   ];
 *   tData[10 + 1] = 0; // We don't have prev/next.
 *
 *   lView[10] = undefined;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `undefined`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = undefined; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 *
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into the static `TStylingStatic` too see if there is a default value for
 * `dynamic` (there is not). Therefore it is safe to remove it.
 *
 * If setting `true` case:
 * ```
 *   lView[10] = true;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `true`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = true; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into `TNode.residualClass` (TNode.residualStyle) which contains
 * ```
 *   tNode.residualClass = [
 *     'TEMPLATE': true,
 *   ];
 * ```
 *
 * This means that it is safe to add class.

     * context.
     */

    /**
     * Points to the declaration component view, used to track transplanted `LView`s.
     *
     * See: `DECLARATION_VIEW` which points to the actual `LView` where it was declared, whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to the component which may not be same as
     * `DECLARATION_VIEW`.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *  <div *ngIf="true">
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *  </div>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above case `DECLARATION_VIEW` for `myTmpl` points to the `LView` of `ngIf` whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to `LView` of the `myComp` which owns the template.
     *
     * The reason for this is that all embedded views are always check-always whereas the component
     * view can be check-always or on-push. When we have a transplanted view it is important to
     * determine if we have transplanted a view from check-always declaration to on-push insertion
     * point. In such a case the transplanted view needs to be added to the `LContainer` in the
     * declared `LView` and CD during the declared view CD (in addition to the CD at the insertion
     * point.) (Any transplanted views which are intra Component are of no interest because the CD
     * strategy of declaration and insertion will always be the same, because it is the same
     * component.)
     *
     * Queries already track moved views in `LView[DECLARATION_LCONTAINER]` and
     * `LContainer[MOVED_VIEWS]`. However the queries also track `LView`s which moved within the same
     * component `LView`. Transplanted views are a subset of moved views, and we use
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` to differentiate them. As in this example.
     *
     * Example showing intra component `LView` movement.
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
     *   <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
     *   <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * The `thenBlock` and `elseBlock` is moved but not transplanted.
     *
     * Example showing inter component `LView` movement (transplanted view).
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *   <insertion-component [template]="myTmpl"></insertion-component>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above example `myTmpl` is passed into a different component. If `insertion-component`
     * instantiates `myTmpl` and `insertion-component` is on-push then the `LContainer` needs to be
     * marked as containing transplanted views and those views need to be CD as part of the
     * declaration CD.
     *
     *
     * When change detection runs, it iterates over `[MOVED_VIEWS]` and CDs any child `LView`s where
     * the `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` of the current component and the child `LView` does not match
     * (it has been transplanted across components.)
     *
     * Note: `[DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW]` points to itself if the LView is a component view (the
     *       simplest / most common case).
     *
     * see also:
     *   - https://hackmd.io/@mhevery/rJUJsvv9H write up of the problem
